## Anomaly Detection in Road Traffic Using Visual Surveillance: A Survey
1. Arxiv 2019
2. Santhosh Kelathodi Kumaran and Debi Prosad Dogra and Partha Pratim Roy

- Abstract—Computer vision has evolved in the last decade as
a key technology for numerous applications replacing human
supervision. 
- In this paper, we present a survey on relevant visual
surveillance related researches for anomaly detection in public
places, focusing primarily on roads. Firstly, we revisit the surveys
done in the last 10 years in this field. Since the underlying
building block of a typical anomaly detection is learning, we
emphasize more on learning methods applied on video scenes.

- We then summarize the important contributions made during last
six years on anomaly detection primarily focusing on features,
underlying techniques, applied scenarios and types of anomalies
using single static camera.

- Finally, we discuss the challenges in
the computer vision related anomaly detection techniques and
some of the important future possibilities

## A Short Survey on Probabilistic Reinforcement Learning
1. Arxiv 2019
2. Reazul Hasan Russel

- A reinforcement learning agent tries to maximize its cumulative payoff by interacting in an unknown environment. It is important for the agent to explore
suboptimal actions as well as to pick actions with highest known rewards. Yet, in
sensitive domains, collecting more data with exploration is not always possible,
but it is important to find a policy with a certain performance guaranty. In this
paper, we present a brief survey of methods available in the literature for balancing exploration-exploitation trade off and computing robust solutions from fixed
samples in reinforcement learning

## A Survey of the Recent Architectures of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
1. Arxiv 2019
2. Asifullah Khan and Anabia Sohail and Umme Zahoora and Aqsa Saeed Qureshi

- Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a special type of Neural Networks, which
have shown state-of-the-art results on various competitive benchmarks. The powerful learning
ability of deep CNN is largely achieved with the use of multiple non-linear feature extraction
stages that can automatically learn hierarchical representation from the data. 

    ![Arxiv](Pictures/5.png)

- Availability of a
large amount of data and improvements in the hardware processing units have accelerated the
research in CNNs and recently very interesting deep CNN architectures are reported. The recent
race in deep CNN architectures for achieving high performance on the challenging benchmarks
has shown that the innovative architectural ideas, as well as parameter optimization, can improve
the CNN performance on various vision-related tasks. 
- In this regard, different ideas in the CNN
design have been explored such as use of different activation and loss functions, parameter
optimization, regularization, and restructuring of processing units. However, the major
improvement in representational capacity is achieved by the restructuring of the processing units.
Especially, the idea of using a block as a structural unit instead of a layer is gaining substantial
appreciation.

- This survey thus focuses on the intrinsic taxonomy present in the recently reported
CNN architectures and consequently, classifies the recent innovations in CNN architectures into
seven different categories. These seven categories are based on spatial exploitation, depth, multipath, width, feature map exploitation, channel boosting and attention. Additionally, it covers the
elementary understanding of the CNN components and sheds light on the current challenges and
applications of CNNs.

## A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Neural Networks
1. Arxiv 2019
2. Zonghan Wu and Shirui Pan and Fengwen Chen and Guodong Long and Chengqi Zhang and Philip S. Yu

- Abstract—Deep learning has revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent years, ranging from image classification and video
processing to speech recognition and natural language understanding. The data in these tasks are typically represented in the
Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and
are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has
imposed significant challenges on existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning
approaches for graph data have emerged. 

    ![Arxiv](Pictures/11.png)
    
- In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in
data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-the-art graph neural networks into different
categories. With a focus on graph convolutional networks, we review alternative architectures that have recently been developed; these
learning paradigms include graph attention networks, graph autoencoders, graph generative networks, and graph spatial-temporal
networks. 

    ![Arxiv](Pictures/12.png)
    
- We further discuss the applications of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source codes
and benchmarks of the existing algorithms on different learning tasks. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this
fast-growing field.
